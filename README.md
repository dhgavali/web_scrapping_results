This project is simple python script to web scrap the Result site of University.

2. Using the selenium and chromedriver it enters the enrollment number of student to fetch result
3. New window is opened when the input is submitted and the data is scrapped from that window using the xpath and other element access functionalities
4. After getting the result it simply closes the window and again repeats with next seat no or enrollnemnt number.
